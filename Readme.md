# CSE-224-CA1

> Android App — Course Assignment 1 for CSE-224  

## 📄 Overview  
This repository contains the source code and supporting files for Assignment 1 of course **CSE-224**. The project is implemented in Kotlin as an Android application.  
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in Android app development (layouts, UI, activity lifecycle, basic user interaction).  

## 📁 Repository Structure  

- **`AndroidManifest.xml`**: Android manifest file.  
- **`MainActivity.kt`**: Contains the main logic of the app.  
- **`activity_main.xml`**: Defines the user interface layout.  
- **`SS1.png` to `SS5.png`**: Screenshot images showing the UI / app behavior in various states.  
- **`GauravCA1.pdf`**: The formal assignment report/documentation in PDF form.  

## 🛠️ Getting Started / How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gauravgujjar663/androidproject.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio (or your preferred Kotlin/Android IDE).
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device (minimum SDK as per assignment requirements).
4. The main activity will launch and show the UI defined in activity_main.xml.

## Technologies Used
